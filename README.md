# PowerToTheParents
Project made during the Intel Hackathon 2015 #IntelMaker #IoT

# Description
On modern days often kids are alone at home. How do parents can enforce, for example, the right amount of time on TV for their kids?
PowerToParents gives to parents the ability of describing how long their kids can use an appliance when they ask for it.
