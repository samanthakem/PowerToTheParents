# PowerToTheParents
Project made during the Intel Hackathon #IntelMaker #IoT

# Description
On modern days often kids are alone at home. How can parents enforce, for example, the right amount of time on TV for their kids?
PowerToParents give to parents the ability of describing how long their kids can use an appliance when they ask for.
